Students are required to design and implement using high quality professional code, a medium sized program, that demonstrates knowledge and use of latest language features, tools, and conventions. Additional topics introduced will include as needed for projects: inheritance and polymorphism; anonymous inner classes, lambda functions, performance analysis to discover and optimize critical code blocks. Students learn about industry standards for code development. Students will design and implement a medium size project with a more advanced user-interface design, such as a web or mobile application with a GUI and event- driven implementation; use of version-control software. </p>
