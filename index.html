        <h2>A Brief Introduction</h2>
        <p>A junior at UW-Madison pursuing Data Science & Information Science majors alongside Computer Science & Math Certificates.
            Particularly interested in AI and Machine Learning, their influence to the world, and how they interact around us.
            Hoping to pursue a career in AI/ML research and development, and potentially getting into business. My strength lies in my
            ability to see potential whenever possible. My ultimate goal is to go back to my home country, Indonesia, to create meaningful
            impact that would contribute to the 2045 Indonesian golden generation. I see a lot of potential that has not been fully 
            utilized yet, and I want to be part of the change that would help my country reach its full potential.
        </p>
        <p>My core belief is the idea that experience, connection, and performance are keys to success. Having a wide range of experiences
            allows me to see things from different perspectives, to connect the dots better. Connections are important because
            they allow me to learn from others and gain new insights. Performance is crucial because it is the ultimate measure of success.
            I believe that by focusing on these three areas, I can achieve my goals and make a positive impact in the world.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I was born in 2005, in Indonesia. My family is considered wealthy by Indonesian standards, so while staying in Indonesia would 
            ensure my family's comfort, I wanted to challenge myself to get experience that will forge me to be someone on my own. I decided to go
            to the U.S. for college. The idea is not to get a degree, but to get experience and connections that would elevate my value as a person.
            Here, I am grateful to have been able to exprience the hard life as a student, far away from home, and having to learn to be 
            independent. My plan is to graduate either in Winter 2026 or Spring 2027, depending on the circumstances before going into either
            industry or research. Then, I am planning to get a master's degree in the field of AI/ML before going back to Indonesia to start a
            business. I understand that this is a long journey, and that my plan might change along the way, but I am committed to making it happen.
        </p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading books, especially non-fiction and self-development books. I also like to play video games, watch movies,
            listen to music, and do some workout. I like to explore new things and learn new skills, and I am always looking for ways to improve myself 
            everyday as I believe we as humans will always have something new to learn no matter how old we get.
